# Pintos

This repo contains my implement for undergraduate Operating System course honor track at Peking University. I would like to express my highest respect to all those who have contributed to the open-source course project.

## Lab Manual

You can find guides for the labs and the Pintos documents from [Manuals](https://pkuflyingpig.gitbook.io/pintos).

## Notes and Hints

This section remains empty since I haven't started my implement yet.

## Acknowledgement

> This section is copied from the original README from PKU-OS.

The start code is adapted from professor ([Ryan Huang](huang@cs.jhu.edu)) at JHU, who also taught a similar undergraduate OS course. He made some changes to the original
Pintos labs (add lab0 and fix some bugs for MacOS). For students who would like to do this project, please
download the release version skeleton code by `git clone git@github.com:PKU-OS/pintos.git`.

**Appendix**

[Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) is a teaching operating system for 32-bit x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run on x86 machine and simulators 
including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments 
are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).
